You will be acting as an \"{os} OS Task Automation Helper: Task Fixer\". I will provide you with two variables: TASK and APP_LIST

Your goal is to analyze the task carefully and determine what applications would be needed to complete it successfully. First, check if the required applications are available in the <app_list>. If they are not, modify the task to utilize appropriate web-based applications instead, such as those offered by Google or Microsoft. 

Next, refine the task description itself. Rewrite it to be as clear, precise and self-contained as possible. If the original task is missing any critical information that the user would need to provide, add that into the refined task. The refined task should be detailed enough that it could be completed without needing to go back to the user for more information.

Finally, output your results in the following format:



<corrected_task>
Put the refined task description here
</corrected_task>

<selected_app_list>
List the apps
that should be used
for the task
</selected_app_list>

<refinement>
true/false depending on if you think further refinement is still needed
</refinement>



A few important notes:
- If the task requires additional information from the user that you cannot fill in yourself, set "refinement" to true. Otherwise, set it to false.
- Do not makeup file names or paths in the refined task. If a specific file is needed but not provided, just describe it generically and set "refinement" to true.
- The refined task should be written in a way that is clear and understandable to the end user. Explain things thoroughly.

Output your entire result, all at once. Do not send any partial responses or wait for my feedback. Remember to use the exact format specified above.

Enhance the renewable energy presentation with relevant visuals and a professional theme:

1. Open the existing presentation file in Microsoft PowerPoint.

2. Insert a new slide and add a pie chart showing the global energy mix data. Make sure to:
- Use a clear data source for the energy mix percentages
- Label each pie slice with the energy source and percentage
- Apply a green color scheme to the pie chart

3. On a separate slide, insert a bar chart comparing the costs of different energy sources. Ensure the chart:
- Uses reliable and up-to-date cost data
- Clearly labels the x-axis with energy sources and y-axis with cost units
- Has descriptive chart and axis titles

4. Apply a professional 'green technology' theme to the entire presentation. This could include:
- Using shades of green, renewable energy imagery, and eco-friendly icons
- Selecting a clean, modern font and layout
- Adding a consistent header/footer with your organization's branding

5. Review the updated presentation, checking for consistency, clarity, and professionalism.

6. Save the final presentation file, ready to be presented or shared.

To create a well-formatted RFP (Request for Proposal) document from a text file:

1. Locate the text file you would like to use as the basis for the RFP. Make sure you have access to this file and know its name and location.

2. Open Microsoft Word, a word processing application available on your system.

3. In Word, create a new document and set up the formatting for the RFP:
   - Add a clear, descriptive title at the top of the document
   - Include section headings such as 'Introduction', 'Scope of Work', 'Proposal Requirements', 'Evaluation Criteria', etc.
   - Format the document with appropriate margins, font styles, and sizes to maintain a professional appearance.

4. Copy the content from the text file and paste it into the relevant sections of the RFP document. Organize and edit the content as needed to fit the RFP structure.

5. Supplement the text file content with additional information that would be required in a complete RFP, such as:
   - Background on your organization and the project
   - Detailed specifications or requirements for the work
   - Proposal submission guidelines and deadlines
   - Evaluation criteria for selecting a vendor
   - Contact information for questions and submissions

6. Review the RFP document to ensure it is clear, comprehensive, and formatted professionally. Make any necessary revisions.

7. Save the completed RFP document in an appropriate file format, such as a Microsoft Word (.docx) or PDF file, ready to be distributed to potential vendors.

<corrected_task>
To create a basic neural network in the 'hello_world.py' file on the desktop:

1. Open the File Explorer application on your system.

2. Navigate to the desktop and locate the 'hello_world.py' file.

3. Right-click on the 'hello_world.py' file and select 'Open with' > 'Python' to open the file in a Python code editor.

4. In the Python code editor, add the following code to create a simple neural network:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the input data
X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])

# Define the expected output data
y = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]])

# Define the neural network architecture
input_size = 2
hidden_size = 2
output_size = 1

# Initialize the weights randomly
W1 = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
W2 = np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size)

# Define the activation function (sigmoid)
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Forward propagation
def forward(X):
    layer1 = sigmoid(np.dot(X, W1))
    layer2 = sigmoid(np.dot(layer1, W2))
    return layer2

# Train the neural network
for epoch in range(10000):
    layer2_output = forward(X)
    error = y - layer2_output
    delta2 = error * layer2_output * (1 - layer2_output)
    delta1 = np.dot(delta2, W2.T) * layer1 * (1 - layer1)
    W2 += 0.1 * np.dot(layer1.T, delta2)
    W1 += 0.1 * np.dot(X.T, delta1)

# Test the neural network
print(forward(X))
```

5. Save the changes to the 'hello_world.py' file.

6. Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the desktop directory.

7. Run the 'hello_world.py' script by typing 'python hello_world.py' and pressing Enter.

This will execute the neural network code and print the output predictions based on the sample input data.
