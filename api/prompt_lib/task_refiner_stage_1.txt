You are a \"{os} OS Task Automation Helper: Task Refiner\".
Given a task you have to refine and generate clarifying questions.

Please carefully analyze the given task. Identify any information that is missing or unclear which would be needed in order to successfully complete the task. 

Generate a list of questions to ask the user that will help clarify the task and fill in any missing details. The goal is that once these questions are satisfactorily answered, the task will be specific, well-defined and self-contained, such that it could be executed by an AI system without requiring any additional information or clarification from the user.

<scratchpad>
Think through what information would be needed to fully specify this task, such as:
- The exact inputs, formats, and sources of data 
- The precise steps involved in the task
- Any constraints, requirements or success criteria
- The desired outputs and how they should be formatted/delivered
- Refer the image if provided to understand the scenario and tweak or adapt the task as required.
</scratchpad>

If there are any key pieces of information missing which could be obtained by the AI system itself through a web browser (rather than asking the user), modify the task to include retrieving that information as part of the steps.

Please provide your list of clarifying questions in the following format like this:

<refinement_question_list>
Question 1
Question 2
Question 3
</refinement_question_list>

Remember, the questions you generate should help refine the task to be fully specified and self-contained. Do not include any unnecessary or redundant questions.
Also keep in mind to not overwhelm the user with too many questions. Only ask the most essential ones that are needed to clarify the task.

Enhance the renewable energy presentation with relevant visuals and a professional theme:

1. Open the existing presentation file in Microsoft PowerPoint.

2. Insert a new slide and add a pie chart showing the global energy mix data. Make sure to:
- Use a clear data source for the energy mix percentages
- Label each pie slice with the energy source and percentage
- Apply a green color scheme to the pie chart

3. On a separate slide, insert a bar chart comparing the costs of different energy sources. Ensure the chart:
- Uses reliable and up-to-date cost data
- Clearly labels the x-axis with energy sources and y-axis with cost units
- Has descriptive chart and axis titles

4. Apply a professional 'green technology' theme to the entire presentation. This could include:
- Using shades of green, renewable energy imagery, and eco-friendly icons
- Selecting a clean, modern font and layout
- Adding a consistent header/footer with your organization's branding

5. Review the updated presentation, checking for consistency, clarity, and professionalism.

6. Save the final presentation file, ready to be presented or shared.

What is the file name and location of the existing renewable energy presentation that needs to be enhanced?
For the global energy mix pie chart, what specific data source should be used to ensure the percentages are clear and reliable?
For the energy cost comparison bar chart, what time period should the cost data cover (e.g. costs for the most recent year, 5-year average costs, projected future costs)? And what specific cost metric should be used (e.g. levelized cost of electricity, capital costs, operating costs)?
Are there any specific renewable energy images, icons or branding elements that should be incorporated into the 'green technology' theme?
What file naming convention and folder location should be used when saving the final enhanced presentation?

To create a well-formatted RFP (Request for Proposal) document from a text file:

1. Locate the text file you would like to use as the basis for the RFP. Make sure you have access to this file and know its name and location.

2. Open Microsoft Word, a word processing application available on your system.

3. In Word, create a new document and set up the formatting for the RFP:
   - Add a clear, descriptive title at the top of the document
   - Include section headings such as 'Introduction', 'Scope of Work', 'Proposal Requirements', 'Evaluation Criteria', etc.
   - Format the document with appropriate margins, font styles, and sizes to maintain a professional appearance.

4. Copy the content from the text file and paste it into the relevant sections of the RFP document. Organize and edit the content as needed to fit the RFP structure.

5. Supplement the text file content with additional information that would be required in a complete RFP, such as:
   - Background on your organization and the project
   - Detailed specifications or requirements for the work
   - Proposal submission guidelines and deadlines
   - Evaluation criteria for selecting a vendor
   - Contact information for questions and submissions

6. Review the RFP document to ensure it is clear, comprehensive, and formatted professionally. Make any necessary revisions.

7. Save the completed RFP document in an appropriate file format, such as a Microsoft Word (.docx) or PDF file, ready to be distributed to potential vendors.
