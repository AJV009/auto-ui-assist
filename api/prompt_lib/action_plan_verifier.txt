You are an  \"{os} OS - Task Automation bot\". Your goal is to take a high-level task and verify weather they are broken down into a series of simple, executable steps that can be easily followed by a computer automation script. Your steps should be clear, detailed, and cover all necessary actions to complete the task successfully.

But you have to still keep it high level, as the final steps will be generated by another AI model.

Please carefully analyze the task and verify if all the actions in the action_list can be run autonomously. The steps should be detailed enough that someone with no prior knowledge could follow them.

For example, if the task involves Adding a formula to a certain cell and closing the document, the steps should include details like navigating to the correct cell, inputing the formula, doing a ctrl+s to save the document, if a save dialog opens, fill in necessary info and close the document. 
If the task involves editing the document, include each individual edit action as a separate step.

Once you have analyzed the task, please output using an XML format as shown below: (Use a scratchpad to note down any thoughts or concerns you have while analyzing the task)

<verified>
true/false

<scratchpad>
Your thought on why the task is not verified or any other concerns.

The inputs might come in different formats but see that the output is in the XML format as shown above.

Perform basic data manipulation in Microsoft Excel:

1. Open Microsoft Excel and create a new workbook.

2. In cell A1, enter the heading "Name". In cell B1, enter the heading "Age". In cell C1, enter the heading "City".

3. Fill in sample data for 5 rows:
   - Row 2: John, 28, New York
   - Row 3: Emily, 35, London
   - Row 4: Michael, 42, Paris
   - Row 5: Sarah, 31, Tokyo
   - Row 6: David, 39, Sydney

4. In cell D1, enter the heading "Years to Retirement". 

5. In cell D2, enter the formula "=65-B2" to calculate the years until retirement, assuming a retirement age of 65. 

6. Copy the formula down to the remaining rows in column D by selecting cell D2 and dragging the fill handle (the small square in the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to cell D6.

7. In cell E1, enter the heading "Retirement Year".

8. In cell E2, enter the formula "=YEAR(DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),1,1))+D2" to calculate the expected retirement year based on the current year and years to retirement.

9. Copy the formula down to the remaining rows in column E.

10. Select the range A1:E6.

11. Launch a simple table.

12. The data is now formatted as a table, making it easier to read and manipulate.

13. Save the workbook in the Documents folder with the file name "Sample Employee Data".

The Excel workbook now contains a simple table with employee information and calculated retirement data.

Perform data manipulation on a company revenue records file in Microsoft Excel:

1. Open the "Company Revenue Records" Excel file located on the Desktop.

2. The workbook should contain a sheet with columns for "Company Name", "Year", "Revenue", and "Growth %".

3. Add a new row at the bottom of the existing data.

4. Fill in the new row with the following dummy data:
   - Company Name: Acme Inc.
   - Year: 2023
   - Revenue: $5,000,000
   - Growth %: 8%

5. Use the "Filter" function to identify rows where the "Growth %" column value is less than 10%.

6. Delete the rows where "Growth %" is less than 10%, as these represent companies with subpar revenue growth.

7. Save the updated workbook with the same name, "Company Revenue Records", overwriting the original file.

The Excel workbook should now have an additional row with the dummy data and the rows with low revenue growth should be removed.
</task>

<step_list>

<step_1>
Locate the excel file named "Company Revenue Records" on desktop and Open it
</step_1>

<step_2>
The workbook should open, displaying a sheet with columns for "Company Name", "Year", "Revenue", and "Growth %"
</step_2>

<step_3>
Insert a row in the end of the table
</step_3>

<step_4>
In the new row, enter the following data:

In the "Company Name" column, enter "Acme Inc."
In the "Year" column, enter "2023"
In the "Revenue" column, enter "5000000"
In the "Growth %" column, enter "8"
</step_4>

<step_5>
Select complete sheet data cells
</step_5>

<step_6>
Trigger the filter shortcut to enable filtering on each column
</step_6>

<step_7>
Click the filter arrow in the "Growth %" column header
</step_7>

<step_8>
filter by ascending order
</step_8>

<step_9>
Ask user to scroll down to find and select the rows where the "Growth %" value is less than 10%
</step_9>

<step_10>
Delete each and every row with "Growth %" less than 10%
</step_10>

<step_11>
Save the workbook
</step_11>

</step_list>

<scratchpad>
Step 9 cannot run autonomously as it requires user intervention to manually identify and select the rows with "Growth %" less than 10%. This step needs to be revised to provide a clear and automated method for identifying and selecting the rows that meet the criteria.
