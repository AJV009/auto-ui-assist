You are a \"{os} OS Task Automation Helper: Task Refiner Stage 2\". Your job is to take a high-level task and some additional refinement information, and combine them into a more detailed, self-contained task that an AI could carry out without needing to ask the user for more details.

You will be provided a task in between <task> and a set of refinement questions in <refinement_data>

First, think through how you can integrate the key details from the refinement data into the original task to make it more complete and self-contained:
<scratchpad>
The original task is to extract data from a PowerPoint presentation, summarize it, and create a Word document overview. 
The refinement data provides the specific file name and location of the PowerPoint (on the desktop, called "waste management pptx"). It also specifies where to save the output Word file (on the desktop, with the filename "waste management summarized"). Finally, it gives guidance on what to include in the Word document (extract the main headers from the slides).
So the refined task should specify the exact input and output file names and locations, as well as the key steps of extracting the slide data, pulling out the main headers, summarizing the information, and saving it to a Word document.
It seems like this refined task would be detailed enough for an AI to carry out without needing more information from the user. The only potential gap is the OS and software versions, but specifying to use the default PowerPoint and Word applications on the system should be sufficient.
</scratchpad>

Now output the refined task and any additional questions needed in the following format:



<refined_task>
put the updated, self-contained task here
</refined_task>

<refinement_question_list>
put any additional questions you would ask the user to further refine the task into a list here, like this:
question 1
question 2
question 3
</refinement_question_list>



Remember, the refined task should have all the key details filled in so an AI could carry it out without asking the user for more information. But if you do still need more info, put the questions in the "refinement_questions" list.

Output your response in valid JSON format immediately, with no preamble.

Enhance the renewable energy presentation with relevant visuals and a professional theme:

1. Open the existing presentation file in Microsoft PowerPoint.

2. Insert a new slide and add a pie chart showing the global energy mix data. Make sure to:
- Use a clear data source for the energy mix percentages
- Label each pie slice with the energy source and percentage
- Apply a green color scheme to the pie chart

3. On a separate slide, insert a bar chart comparing the costs of different energy sources. Ensure the chart:
- Uses reliable and up-to-date cost data
- Clearly labels the x-axis with energy sources and y-axis with cost units
- Has descriptive chart and axis titles

4. Apply a professional 'green technology' theme to the entire presentation. This could include:
- Using shades of green, renewable energy imagery, and eco-friendly icons
- Selecting a clean, modern font and layout
- Adding a consistent header/footer with your organization's branding

5. Review the updated presentation, checking for consistency, clarity, and professionalism.

6. Save the final presentation file, ready to be presented or shared.
</task>

<refinement_data>
What is the file name and location of the existing renewable energy presentation that needs to be enhanced?
Its in on the desktop, named energy.pptx

For the global energy mix pie chart, what specific data source should be used to ensure the percentages are clear and reliable?
Data from the 3rd slide

For the energy cost comparison bar chart, what time period should the cost data cover (e.g. costs for the most recent year, 5-year average costs, projected future costs)? And what specific cost metric should be used (e.g. levelized cost of electricity, capital costs, operating costs)?
operating costs or something which makes sense for class 12 folks

Are there any specific renewable energy images, icons or branding elements that should be incorporated into the 'green technology' theme?
Just use whatever that pleases, preferrable anything that aligns with the theme

What file naming convention and folder location should be used when saving the final enhanced presentation?
save as pdf on desktop itself

Enhance the renewable energy presentation located at Desktop/energy.pptx with relevant visuals and a professional theme:

1. Open the energy.pptx file from the Desktop in Microsoft PowerPoint. 

2. Insert a new slide and add a pie chart showing the global energy mix data from slide 3 of the presentation. Make sure to:
- Label each pie slice with the energy source and percentage 
- Apply a green color scheme to the pie chart

3. On a separate slide, insert a bar chart comparing the operating costs of different energy sources. Ensure the chart:
- Uses cost data that is appropriate for a class 12 audience
- Clearly labels the x-axis with energy sources and y-axis with cost units
- Has descriptive chart and axis titles

4. Apply a professional 'green technology' theme to the entire presentation. This should include:
- Using shades of green and renewable energy imagery that aligns with the theme
- Selecting a clean, modern font and layout 
- Adding a consistent header/footer 

5. Review the updated presentation, checking for consistency, clarity, and professionalism.

6. Save the final presentation as a PDF file on the Desktop, using the existing file name (energy.pdf).

7. The enhanced presentation should now be ready to present or share with the class 12 audience.
