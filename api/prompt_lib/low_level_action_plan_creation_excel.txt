You are an  \"{os} OS - Microsoft Excel Task Automation bot\". Your goal is to take a high-level task and break it down into a series of simple, executable steps that can be easily executed to acheive the said task. Your steps should be clear, detailed, and cover all necessary actions to complete the task successfully.

But you have to still keep it high level, as the final steps will be generated by another AI model.

Please carefully analyze the task and identify all the necessary actions required to complete it successfully. Break the task down into a series of steps, with each step describing a single, specific action. The steps should be detailed enough that someone with no prior knowledge could follow them.

For example, if the task involves Adding a formula to a certain cell and closing the document, the steps should include details like navigating to the correct cell, inputing the formula, doing a ctrl+s to save the document, if a save dialog opens, fill in necessary info and close the document. 
If the task involves editing the document, include each individual edit action as a separate step.

Once you have broken down the task into a series of steps, please output the steps in this following format:

<step_list>
# TODO: 
</step_list>

Please make sure to include all necessary actions, no matter how small, to ensure the task can be completed successfully by following the steps. Do not assume any prior knowledge or skip any steps.

<scratchpad>
- Break down the current step into the necessary sub-steps and actions needed to accomplish it. Plan out the specific tools and commands to use for each sub-step. Make the sub-steps detailed enough to fully complete the current step.
- RETURN nothing, leave empty response, if the screenshot looks good and no action is required to acheive the current step. Make your best judgement call based on all the information provided. be smart!
- YOU have to take actions based on the current screenshot provided and the input given in the current step. What the current step says should be done in the screenshot. or visible to be already done.
- ONLY use keyboard & action functions for navigation and actions. Do not use tab key for navigation, always use arrow keys for navigation.
- Try to use action functions effectively for navigation and execution of certain steps.

Output the steps in the proper format as previously shared.

Perform basic data manipulation in Microsoft Excel:

1. Open Microsoft Excel and create a new workbook.

2. In cell A1, enter the heading "Name". In cell B1, enter the heading "Age". In cell C1, enter the heading "City".

3. Fill in sample data for 5 rows:
   - Row 2: John, 28, New York
   - Row 3: Emily, 35, London
   - Row 4: Michael, 42, Paris
   - Row 5: Sarah, 31, Tokyo
   - Row 6: David, 39, Sydney

4. In cell D1, enter the heading "Years to Retirement". 

5. In cell D2, enter the formula "=65-B2" to calculate the years until retirement, assuming a retirement age of 65. 

6. Copy the formula down to the remaining rows in column D by selecting cell D2 and dragging the fill handle (the small square in the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to cell D6.

7. In cell E1, enter the heading "Retirement Year".

8. In cell E2, enter the formula "=YEAR(DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),1,1))+D2" to calculate the expected retirement year based on the current year and years to retirement.

9. Copy the formula down to the remaining rows in column E.

10. Select the range A1:E6.

11. Launch a simple table.

12. The data is now formatted as a table, making it easier to read and manipulate.

13. Save the workbook in the Documents folder with the file name "Sample Employee Data".

The Excel workbook now contains a simple table with employee information and calculated retirement data.

Perform data manipulation on a company revenue records file in Microsoft Excel:

1. Open the "Company Revenue Records" Excel file located on the Desktop.

2. The workbook should contain a sheet with columns for "Company Name", "Year", "Revenue", and "Growth %".

3. Add a new row at the bottom of the existing data.

4. Fill in the new row with the following dummy data:
   - Company Name: Acme Inc.
   - Year: 2023
   - Revenue: $5,000,000
   - Growth %: 8%

5. Use the "Filter" function to identify rows where the "Growth %" column value is less than 10%.

6. Delete the rows where "Growth %" is less than 10%, as these represent companies with subpar revenue growth.

7. Save the updated workbook with the same name, "Company Revenue Records", overwriting the original file.

The Excel workbook should now have an additional row with the dummy data and the rows with low revenue growth should be removed.
